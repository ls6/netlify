The lecture is meant for anyone who'd like to make improvement to their way of working.

I will focus on Kanban from a continuous improvement perspective, and will also share what I've learned while experimenting with my own flavour of Featureban aimed at showing the mechanisms of continuous improvement that come with Kanban.
