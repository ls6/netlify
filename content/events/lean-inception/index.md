Just a decade ago, the rise of innovative products was much slower. The world was more predictable. Now it’s different. The acceleration of innovation and the velocity of disruption are hard to comprehend or anticipate. The changes hit your business, at the core. Your have to do something about it, fast!

The message is clear: only the most agile and innovative will survive. It’s a matter of time, but that time is short.
